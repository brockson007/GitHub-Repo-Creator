  - Initializes local Git directory
  - Adds all of the files from the project folder to Git
  - Creates the "first commit"
  - Creates a GitHub repository based on the name of the project folder you are trying to push.
  - Pushes the files to GitHub

Prerequisites: 
  - Git must be installed. Link: https://git-scm.com/
  - The Hub extension for Git must also be installed: Link: https://github.com/github/hub
  - You must must first navigate into the directory of the project you want to push via the shell of your choice.
 
Usage: 
You can either copy this file into the project folder and run it or you can put the file into a folder of your choice and create a Environment Variable.
By creating an Environment Variable, you can run the batch file anywhere from your shell by just refering to the name of the batch file.
